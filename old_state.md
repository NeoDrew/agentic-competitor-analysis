### Frequently asked questions.

Which Vercel plan is right for me?

Our Hobby plan is for personal, non-commercial use. Pro is for small teams with moderate usage and collaboration requirements. Enterprise is for teams seeking greater performance, collaboration, and security. [Contact our sales team](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/contact/sales) to learn more.

Do you offer custom invoicing?

Yes, we offer custom invoicing for Enterprise customers. [Contact our sales team](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/contact/sales) to learn more.

What are the limits for each plan?

Our limits are listed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/platform/limits). Additionally, check out our [Fair Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines).

I went over my limits. What can I do?

We are glad you are growing and scaling with Vercel! Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/contact/sales) to discuss your resource requirements and we can customize a plan for your team.

Can I buy additional usage?

Yes! On top of your included usage on Pro, you can pay as you go for additional products like Fast Data Transfer (starting at $0.15 per GB) and Edge Requests (starting at $2 per million), uncapped. If you have a free Hobby account, you are limited to the usage constraints listed on this page and cannot purchase additional usage. Read more details [in our documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/pricing#regional-pricing).

I have a Hobby account, how do I upgrade to a paid plan?

Thanks for continuing to use Vercel! Follow [this guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro#upgrading-to-pro) to upgrade your account.

Is there a limit to how many teams I can have?

No, there is not a limit.

How does Vercel calculate usage?

We calculate the total response size which includes headers along with the number of bytes in the body. Anything served from our servers from your project’s domain will be counted as bandwidth (including JSON responses for Serverless Functions).

When it comes to Serverless Functions though, GB-Hrs is calculated by multiplying the duration that your functions ran for by the amount of memory that was consumed by them.

To learn more, check out the [Usage documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/platform/usage).

I want to transfer a domain name to Vercel. Is there a fee?

Potentially. Transfer fees are dependent on the TLD and the domain renewal fee. The domain-transfer workflow will alert you of fees before initiating transfer.

Do cached responses affect usage?

Caching responses can reduce the usage of Vercel Functions.  
If the function response is [cached](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), it will not run and incur a Function invocation or any GB/hrs of duration. Any request made to Vercel will incur an Edge Request. Requests to static assets incur the same Fast Data Transfer usage if the response is cached or uncached.  
Further, Vercel automatically adds etags to all responses to prevent end users from downloading the same asset many times. Our Edge Network automatically [compresses](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/compression) responses to reduce your Fast Data Transfer.

How can I manage my spend?

We provide customers with tools to observe, control, and alert on their infrastructure spend with [Spend Management](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-spend-management-realtime-usage-alerts-sms-notifications).  
You can define a spend amount (e.g. $40) and receive email, web, and SMS notifications as you reach that amount. When reaching 100%, you can optionally automatically pause all projects with a hard limit.  
Over the past year, we've added features to the platform based on your feedback to help automatically prevent runaway spend, including [recursion protection](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/changelog/automatic-recursion-protection-for-vercel-serverless-functions), [improved function defaults](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/changelog/serverless-functions-can-now-run-up-to-5-minutes), [hard spend limits](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/changelog/improved-hard-caps-for-spend-management), [Attack Challenge Mode](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808014639/https://vercel.com/changelog/prevent-malicious-traffic-with-attack-challenge-mode-for-vercel-firewall), and more.
